[The Magnolia Conference 2012](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/community/magnolia-conference.html) ended last wednesday - it was an overall great experience with a lot to take with and many interesting people and discussions. There is also a <a href="https://blog.namics.com/2012/09/magnolia-conference-2012.html">small blog post about it</a> in my company'sÂ blog.


I'm impressed with the big steps forward Magnolia takes with the new Magnolia 5 Release and its completely new Vaadin-based administration backend.

Really looking forward to the first project with it!
