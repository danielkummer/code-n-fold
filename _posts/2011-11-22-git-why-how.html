<p>It's no secret I'm a huge fan of git and can't stand svn anymore by now; it just annoys me - period.</p>
<p>But it's always hard to convince developers who've used one tool (svn) over many years to accept the fact the tool is outdated and not state-of-the-art anymore in today's development setups and environments.</p>
<p>In this talk I held at work about git I try to highlight the benefits git has over svn as a fully distributed version control system.</p>
<p>The talk itself consists of two parts, the presentation and a hands-on demonstration. I've uploaded only the presentation part....</p>
