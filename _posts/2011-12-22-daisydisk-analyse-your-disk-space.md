Since years i've been using <a title="Disk Inventory X" href="https://www.derlien.com/" target="_blank">DiskInventory X</a> to analyse and clean my disk.

Sadly the tool itself is quite old by now and doen't see active development and updates anymore.

My new recommendation is <a title="DaisyDisk" href="https://daisydiskapp.com/" target="_blank">DaisyDisk</a>. A nice and fast tool which displays the disk space as pie chart. My experiences so far are just positive. Although the full version isn't free its still cheap and worth the money.
