excerpt: Namics internal project - knowledge management

---
My latest company internal rails project just released is a platform for assigning and managing skills.

The application has a few neat features like:
* Skill mass assignment (inclusive creation of new skills)
* Weight based rating system
* Graphical statistics
* Mail notifications
* LDAP Authentication
