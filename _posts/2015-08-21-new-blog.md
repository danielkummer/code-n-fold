excerpt: Ok, it’s time to revitalize this blog. It was practically dead the last two years and I was quite unhappy about it. So I’m trying something new now and include a broader range of topics and articles.

As you might have noticed, a few other things have changed as well:

* {% extlink jekyll http://jekyllrb.com %} is now my blog generator
* I'm hosting this blog using {% extlink GitHub Pages https://pages.github.com/ %}
* I've migrated some of the old blog posts - not all of them

I'm still not completely happy with the way the blog looks at the moment, so you can expect further changes. But for a start it'll do.

So let's see what can be done with this :)
