<h1>The broken window theory</h1>
<p><a href="https://codenfold.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/brokenwindow.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-228" title="brokenwindow" src="assets/brokenwindow-e1335700104101.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="303" /></a>Maybe you've heard of <em>the broken window theory.</em> It was introduced by two social scientists ( <a title="James Q. Wilson" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Q._Wilson">James Q. Wilson</a> and <a title="George L. Kelling" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_L._Kelling">George L. Kelling</a>) in an article titled "Broken Windows" which appeared in March 1982.</p>
<p>The title is named after the following example:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Consider a building with a few broken windows. If the windows are not repaired, the tendency is for vandals to break a few more windows. Eventually, they may even break into the building, and if it's unoccupied, perhaps become squatters or light fires inside. Or consider a sidewalk. Some litter accumulates. Soon, more litter accumulates. Eventually, people even start leaving bags of trash from take-out restaurants there or breaking into cars."</p></blockquote>
<p>More about this theory can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory#See_also">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<h1>Software and broken windows...</h1>
<p>Maybe you're asking yourself "well' that's a nice study, but what's the link to software?"</p>
