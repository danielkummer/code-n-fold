excerpt: A small presentation talking about the differences of git and svn in branching and tooling.
---

Here's another small presentation I held at work about git. This one focuses more on branching and tooling as well as the core differences to svn.

It's not the complete presentation, I had to remove several work-related slides but the essentials are still there.

So... enjoy!
