<p>Here's a small ruby script I wrote to help me facilitate an upcoming git to git migration.<br />
It takes two params, first the name of the repository to be migrated, second the name of the new remote repository.<br />
The script is simple and straightforward, it clones the remote repository to the current directory, fetches all branches, creates a new mirror, pushes all branches and pushes all tags - done.<br />
Feel free to use and further improve it...<br />
Note: The new remote repository must already exist (bare).</p>
