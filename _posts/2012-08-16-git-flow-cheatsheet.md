Those of you who've already read the great blog post [A successful git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) from Vincent Driessens might want to take a look at the [git flow extension](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow/) written by the same author.


The extension allows easy implementation of the described branching model.

I've written a [cheatsheet](https://danielkummer.github.com/git-flow-cheatsheet/) to get you started; enjoy!
