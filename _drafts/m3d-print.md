##  A story from the early days...

I've got some previous experience with 3d printers. I was among a group of working colleagues who all chipped in and bought the first makerbot together. 
If you remember the first makerbot editions you know what early adaptors had to go through:

 The printer was delivered as an assembly kit. You had to build, solder and calibrate it yourself. It took 5 of us and a whole day to get it built and working. 
 Sadly the problems didn't stop there, the printer was quite maintenance intensive, the software was bad and you had to accompany the whole printing process to make sure everything went well.
 The resolution and print quality is also not comparable to the nowaday printers.
 Needless to say we basically all lost interest in the printer after a few months and since then it serves as a rather expensive dust-catcher in a cabinet somewhere...
 
My personal conclusion at that time:
 
* Nice toy
* Too cumbersome to actually use


## My 3D Printing Reboot
   
It all started - as often - with a {% extlink Kickstarter campaign https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/m3d/the-micro-the-first-truly-consumer-3d-printer?lang=de%}. 
The promise made was a relatively cheap and easy to use personal 3d printer. 
There are a few conveniences which lead me to back the project:

* No assembly required
* Small and convenient form factor
* Easy to use
* Comparably cheap price tag (the campaign price was 299 USD for one printer)

These promises were enough for me to seriously consider backing the project - which I did in the end ;)

The whole campaign was very well communicated - there were always updates on the development and production progress as well as the different obstacles the makers encountered during the process.
I wish every campaign would get this level of attention from the initiators!

## The Printer

I've got the printer for about a month now - which enables me to give a few first impressions.

Let's get the bad stuff done with first - not because it's so bad, just because there isn't much to tell...
 
### Cons 

The only true design flaw the printer has in my opinion is the internal filament storage beneath the printing bed. Inserting the filament and routing the thread through the filament tube is extremely cubersome. My filament often broke somewhere in the middle and I almost couldn't remove it anymore. Furthermore the filament motor just doesn't have enough grip and power to "pull" the filament into the extruder nozzle.
So just don't bother with internal filament, having it externally solves all the problems. 
The m3d printer team even provides 3d files for printing out an external filament spool holder which you can attach to the printer frame. 
My recommendation: just do that and be done with it!

The printing software works flawlessly most of the time but still has a "beta" smell on it. It's .NET based which means it operates using the Mono Framework on OSX. 
But the team is obiously still polishing the software and releases new versions frequently. 
Because the software doesn't have a version check feature you'll have to check and download it yourself regularly.

TODO
- ABS not as good as PLA (print wrapping)

### Pros

* Extremely easy to use
* Comparably high quality prints
* No other comparable printer for this price tag
