It's time to talk about another reality concerning 3d printing. The results are not always as expected and there is a chance your print will be completely ruined
by one reason or another.

This is not my first print failure but the first I'm posting here.

## What happened?

Quite simple: After about 50% completion the print got unstuck from the print bed which resulted in the piece of art you see below.
After this I've replaced the BuildTak sheet which should prevent this from happening...
