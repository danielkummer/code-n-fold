## Git-Flow Cheatsheet - my personal community award!

A simple cheatsheet showing in an impressive way of what a community is capable of. It started with the cheatsheet being available in english only - with a fork it ribbon in the right top corner. [This blog post]({% post_url 2012-08-16-git-flow-cheatsheet %}) was the beginning of it all. 
Thanks to the community, GitHub and pull requests the page is now available in 17 languages!
