## About

Hi there and welcome to my blog!

I’m a software engineer currently working at Namics AG, Switzerland.

Create custom or product based complex web solutions to fit our customers’ needs, be it a standalone web application or a multi site and multi client content management system is my job.

As a software engineer I demand professionalism from myself, always thriving towards the ideal of professional software development.
I’m trying to achieve this with constant learning, writing clean, maintainable, understandable and extendable code, selecting the ideal toolset and development setup do fit the projects needs and conduct professional source code development.
So I’d like to share my experience as well as tips and tricks which make your job easier, more productive and, above all, more fun!

\- Enjoy
